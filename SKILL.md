## PCTF-Compliant Multi-modal Creative System

---

## 1. Purpose

Enable commercial-grade multi-modal creative production through a recursive 5-layer Spec system inspired by Gödel, Escher, Bach.

**Core Philosophy**: Creativity emerges from the interplay of constraints and freedom, structure and spontaneity.

---

## 2. Task Definition

### Input
- **project_name**: String
- **medium_type**: movie | music | literature | game | interactive
- **initial_concept**: Text description
- **constraints**: Aesthetic, cognitive, technical (optional)

### Output
- **L1-L5 Specs**: Recursive layered specifications
- **Multi-modal assets**: Text, audio, visual synchronized
- **Consistency report**: Cross-modal alignment verification

### Success Criteria
```yaml
assertions:
  - All 5 layers (L1-L5) are complete and consistent
  - Cross-modal assets are synchronized
  - Aesthetic constraints are satisfied
  - Cognitive load is within acceptable range
  - Output is production-ready
```

## 3. The 5-Layer Spec Architecture

### L1: Worldview Layer (Universe Constitution)
**Question**: "What kinds of existence are possible?"

**Elements**:
- Cosmic rules (physics, metaphysics)
- Historical timeline
- Cultural symbol systems
- Spatial geography
- Power structures

**Constraint**: Rigid - all lower layers must operate within this framework

### L2: Character Layer (Agency)
**Question**: "Whose story? Why does it matter?"

**Elements**:
- Psychological dimension (desires, fears, lies, truths)
- Social dimension (class, relationships, groups)
- Narrative dimension (arc type, function, symbolism)
- Relationship network (graph model)

**Constraint**: Motivation-action consistency

### L3: Narrative Layer (Plot Architecture)
**Question**: "What happens? Why in this way?"

**Elements**:
- Structure (3-act, hero's journey, non-linear, multi-thread)
- Conflict system (internal, interpersonal, supra-personal)
- Information release rhythm
- Theme encoding

**Constraint**: Unity of character motivation and thematic expression

### L4: Beat Layer (Scene Sequencing)
**Question**: "What is the emotional tone now? Fast or slow?"

**Elements**:
- Emotional curve mapping
- Scene function labels
- Rhythm parameters (length, dialogue density, action ratio)

**Constraint**: Serve character arc or thematic expression

### L5: Shot/Execution Layer (Final Encoding)
**Question**: "What does the audience see? Hear?"

**Elements**:
- Spatial choreography
- Temporal design
- Visual grammar
- Technical specifications

**Constraint**: Technical feasibility

## 4. Multi-modal Engine

### Text Module
- Lyrics: rhyme-semantics coupling
- Screenplay: industry-standard formats
- Narrative: perspective and tense control
- Style: parameterized control (not surface imitation)

### Audio Module
- Lyrics → Melody → Arrangement → Mixing
- Harmony-emotion mapping
- Voice-specific optimization
- Closed-loop optimization

### Visual Module
- Concept design (mood boards)
- Storyboard (shot parameters)
- Previz (3D spatial choreography)
- Synchronized with narrative beats

### Cross-modal Consistency
```
Emotion Vector Space (shared representation)
    ↓
Text: Emotional coloring
Audio: Harmonic coloring  
Visual: Color grading
    ↓
Real-time alignment check
Deviation → Alert → Harmonization proposal
```

## 5. Aesthetic Constraints

### Classical Principles
| Principle | Mechanism | Parameters |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Unity & Variety | Theme-variation | Similarity index 0.6-0.8 |
| Proportion & Scale | Golden ratio, Fibonacci | Position, sequence |
| Rhythm & Pattern | Expectation-satisfaction-delay-surprise | Period, gradient |
| Focus & Hierarchy | Selective attention | Priority labeling |

### Contemporary Trends
- Minimalism with meaningful depth
- Retro-futurism (temporal overlay)
- Glitch aesthetics (controlled defects)
- Participatory aesthetics (open framework)

---

## 6. Cognitive Science Constraints

### Attention Economy
- **3-second hook**: Sensory impact, cognitive conflict, suspense, identity
- **15-minute cycle**: Emotional arc per sequence
- **Peak-End Rule**: Memory = f(peak intensity, ending quality)
- **Cognitive Load**: Layered information, schema support, redundant encoding

---

## 7. Recursive Refinement

```
Top-down: Higher layer constrains lower
Bottom-up: Lower implementation enriches/refines higher

When L5 discovers implementation difficulty:
  → Suggest L4 revision
  → Or L3 revision if structural
  → System supports iterative optimization
```

---

## 8. Usage

```bash
# Initialize project
geb-aesthetics init --name "My Film" --type movie

# Generate L1-L5 specs
geb-aesthetics generate --layer all --concept "cyberpunk romance"

# Cross-modal sync check
geb-aesthetics verify --consistency

# Export production package
geb-aesthetics export --format final-cut
```
