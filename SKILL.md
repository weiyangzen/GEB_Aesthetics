# GEB Aesthetics Skill Specification
## Multi-Modal Creative Intelligence System

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: The GEB Trinity

### 1.1 Gödel's Insight: The Limits of Systems

**Incompleteness as Creative Freedom**

Any formal system powerful enough to describe itself contains truths that cannot be proven within the system. For creative AI:

- **The Frame Problem**: The best ideas often come from outside the current context
- **Meta-Creative Space**: True innovation requires stepping outside the system
- **Productive Tension**: Constraints that cannot be fully satisfied drive creative breakthroughs

**Implementation**: The system maintains awareness of its own limitations, using them as generative forces rather than bugs to fix.

### 1.2 Escher's Vision: Self-Reference in Form

**Visual Paradox as Aesthetic Device**

Escher's impossible constructions reveal that form can be content:

- **Meta-Narrative**: Stories about storytelling
- **Nested Worlds**: Realities within realities
- **Observer Effect**: The act of creation changing the creator

**Implementation**: Five-layer Spec architecture where each layer reflects and contains the others.

### 1.3 Bach's Harmony: Constraint Breeds Complexity

**The Fugue as Creative Model**

Multiple independent voices weaving together under strict contrapuntal rules:

- **Voice Independence**: Each modality (text/audio/visual) maintains its own logic
- **Harmonic Convergence**: Cross-modal alignment at emotional peaks
- **Thematic Transformation**: Core motifs appearing in varied forms across scales

**Implementation**: Cross-modal consistency engine ensuring independent voices harmonize.

## 2. Recursive Five-Layer Spec Architecture

### 2.1 Layer 1: Worldview (L1)
**Time Scale**: Generations/Eras  
**Core Question**: "What kinds of existence are possible?"

**Design Elements**:
- Cosmological Rules (physics, metaphysics)
- Historical Timeline (key events, causality chains)
- Cultural Symbol Systems (language, religion, art)
- Spatial Geography (maps, climate, resources)
- Power Structures (politics, economics, social classes)

**Constraint Type**: Rigid - Violations break internal consistency

**Output**: "Cosmic Constitution" - Immutable boundary conditions

### 2.2 Layer 2: Character (L2)
**Time Scale**: Lifetime/Years  
**Core Question**: "Whose story? Why does it matter?"

**Design Elements**:
- Psychological Dimension (core desires, deep fears, cognitive patterns)
- Social Dimension (class position, relationship networks, group affiliations)
- Narrative Dimension (arc type, functional role, symbolic meaning)

**Constraint Type**: Motivation-Action Consistency

**Output**: Character Bible + Relationship Graph

### 2.3 Layer 3: Narrative (L3)
**Time Scale**: Hours/Days  
**Core Question**: "What happens? Why so?"

**Design Elements**:
- Conflict System (internal, interpersonal, supra-personal)
- Information Release Rhythm (when, through whom, how)
- Structural Templates (three-act, hero's journey, circular, network)

**Constraint Type**: Theme-Event Alignment

**Output**: Detailed Outline + Plot Structure Map

### 2.4 Layer 4: Beat (L4)
**Time Scale**: Minutes  
**Core Question**: "Emotion now? Rhythm fast or slow?"

**Design Elements**:
- Emotional Curve (intensity/valence over time)
- Scene Function Labels (advancement, turning point, revelation, emotional ascent, transition)
- Rhythm Parameters (scene length, dialogue density, action ratio)

**Constraint Type**: Narrative Function Completion

**Output**: Scene List + Emotional Curve + Rhythm Parameters

### 2.5 Layer 5: Shot/Execution (L5)
**Time Scale**: Seconds/Frames  
**Core Question**: "What does the audience see? Hear?"

**Design Elements**:
- Spatial Blocking (character-camera relationships)
- Temporal Design (shot duration, editing rhythm, speed changes)
- Visual Grammar (shot scale, angle, movement)

**Constraint Type**: Technical Feasibility

**Output**: Storyboard + Shot List + Technical Specifications

### 2.6 Cross-Layer Dynamics

**Top-Down**: Higher layers constrain lower layers  
**Bottom-Up**: Lower implementations enrich or revise higher understanding  
**Bidirectional Constraint**: Changes at any level trigger consistency checks

## 3. Multi-Modal Consistency Engine

### 3.1 The "Emotion-Form" Mapping Table

Central validation mechanism ensuring cross-modal alignment:

| Emotion Coordinate | Text Expression | Audio Expression | Visual Expression |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Hope in Despair | Dark imagery → light metaphor | Minor → major modulation | Cold tones → warm point light |
| Controlled Panic | Short sentences, technical terms | Staccato rhythm, rising pitch | Rapid cuts, shallow depth |
| Nostalgic Longing | Archaic diction, sensory detail | Slow tempo, reverb-heavy | Desaturated colors, soft focus |

### 3.2 Real-Time Consistency Scoring

```
Consistency Score = Σ(emotion_vector_distance) / n

- Score > 0.8: Aligned
- Score 0.5-0.8: Tension (intentional or error)
- Score < 0.5: Misalignment alert
```

### 3.3 Harmonization Strategies

When misalignment detected:
1. **Dominant Modality**: One modality leads, others adapt
2. **Counterpoint**: Intentional tension for aesthetic effect
3. **Compromise**: Find intermediate emotional position
4. **Revision**: Return to higher layer for constraint adjustment

---

## 4. GEB-Inspired Form Constraints

### 4.1 Self-Referential Systems

**Meta-Narrative Layer**: Story about storytelling  
**Nested Structure**: Stories within stories, dreams within dreams  
**Paradox Design**: Contradictory propositions unified at higher level  
**Observer Effect**: Audience participation changes meaning

### 4.2 Fractal Recursive Structures

**Self-Similarity**: Micro details mirror macro themes  
**Scale Invariance**: Same generation rules apply at all layers  
**Infinite Detail**: New information at every zoom level  
**Boundary Chaos**: Order and randomness at the edge

### 4.3 Cross-Domain Isomorphisms

**Music-Visual-Narrative Mappings**:
- Rhythm ↔ Editing pace
- Harmony ↔ Color palette
- Melody ↔ Camera movement
- Tension-Resolution ↔ Plot structure

## 5. Novelty Quantification

### 5.1 The 70-20-10 Rule

| Dimension | Percentage | Function | Risk |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Familiarity | 70% | Lower barrier, establish connection | Boredom if too high |
| Surprise | 20% | Create memory, spark discussion | Confusion if too high |
| Mystery | 10% | Invite participation, reward re-experience | Alienation if too high |

### 5.2 Controlled Innovation Strategies

1. **Core Premise Inversion**: Change one foundational assumption, derive consequences
2. **Genre Hybridization**: Deep structural fusion (not surface pastiche)
3. **Perspective Flip**: Invert power/time/causality coordinates
4. **Medium Self-Reference**: Expose creation process as content

---

## 6. Four-Phase Creative Workflow

### Phase 1: Framework Generation
**Intent Capture** → **Reference Deconstruction** → **Constraint Specification**

### Phase 2: Constraint Negotiation
**Conflict Detection** → **Priority Sorting** → **Trade-off Visualization**

### Phase 3: Layered Construction
**Top-Down Generation** + **Bottom-Up Emergence** → **Bidirectional Validation**

### Phase 4: Integration Validation
**Structure-Constraint-Content Triangular Check** → **Multi-Modal Consistency Audit**
